# Loops Core Utilities

Use this skill only to consume `@onderwijsin/loops-core`. Treat the package as a framework-neutral utility library; do not infer permission to modify its source, tests, fixtures, CI, release setup, or package API.

## Choose an integration

| Need                                            | Read                                               | Use                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Parse/store LMX or optionally expand components | [references/api.md](references/api.md)             | `parseLoopsLmx`                                              |
| Build a safe renderer                           | [references/rendering.md](references/rendering.md) | AST types, rendering helpers, variables, URLs, inline styles |
| Render conditional Sections                     | [references/api.md](references/api.md)             | `evaluate`                                                   |
| Receive Loops webhooks                          | [references/api.md](references/api.md)             | verification and webhook schemas                             |

## Consumer workflow

1. Install the package: `pnpm add @onderwijsin/loops-core`.
2. Keep HTTP extraction, authentication, persistence, idempotency, queues, campaign policy, and presentation in the consumer application.
3. Keep signing secrets and Loops API keys server-side.
4. Use exported schemas at external boundaries; use `safeParse` where an invalid payload should become an application error response.
5. Render only the supported subset, escape text, resolve variables before presentation, evaluate conditional Sections with `evaluate`, and validate every destination URL.
6. Use `applyInlineStyles` for documented presentation attributes when the consuming framework needs inline styles; keep its `enabled` flag controlled by the renderer rather than persisted AST data.

## Boundaries and safety

- Verify the exact raw webhook body before parsing JSON.
- Call component-expanding `parseLoopsLmx` with `apiKey` only from trusted server code. Omit it to guarantee parsing performs no network I/O.
- Component expansion is the package's only opt-in transport exception; there is no exported Loops client.
- Do not render LMX through `v-html`, `innerHTML`, or an equivalent raw HTML API.
- Treat unsupported nodes as omitted presentation data, not as a parsing failure.
- Treat missing variables and invalid conditional rules as presentation decisions controlled by `evaluate` fallbacks; the evaluator never throws.
- Treat `applyInlineStyles` output as the only supported inline-style mapping; never pass arbitrary `Style` metadata or unknown attributes to a style binding.
- Do not use `Style` metadata as untrusted CSS.

For framework-specific implementation, adapt these outputs to that framework rather than importing the framework into the package. Use the official Loops SDK alongside this package when API client or campaign functionality is needed.
